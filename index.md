        <h1>Hillsborough Community College Early Alert System</h1>
        <img src="assets/HCC.jpg" alt="Studying" "class="center" width="300" height="200">
      </p> This system is designed to support the success of our students by identifying potential challenges early on and providing timely interventions to ensure their academic progress and well-being. 
                <p><h2>
            How It Works
        
           </h2></p>
            
            The Early Alert System utilizes the robust capabilities of our CRM, Salesforce, and integrates with our ERP, Ellucian Colleague, to collect and analyze student data. Through a combination of automated processes and faculty input, the system identifies students who may be facing academic difficulties, attendance issues, or other challenges that may hinder their progress.
        
    <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>The goal would be to establish an effective communications loop between (1) "front line" offices, (2) students, and (3) the early alert team.</p>
